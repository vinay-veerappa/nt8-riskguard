"""Check every mutation battery's anchors WITHOUT running a single mutant.

⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. A battery whose find-string no longer matches prints `[SKIP]`
and scores that mutant a SURVIVOR -- but only when the battery is RUN, and a
battery is only run when the suite is green. So an anchor broken by an unrelated
commit stays invisible for exactly as long as it takes to notice, and this repo
has been caught twice: `mutate_ui2.py`'s anchor was broken by the UI7 commit and
went unnoticed because only the battery that "looked touched" was re-run.

Each battery run is minutes of `dotnet build` per mutant. This is a substring
count, so it is instant -- which means it can be run after EVERY commit that
touches `addons/`, including while the suite is red.

It imports nothing: importing a battery module executes it, because they run at
import time by design. It reads the MUTANTS list out of the source instead.

Exits non-zero if any anchor does not match exactly once.
